    <div> <h2>where are all </h2>
    <p> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
        Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
        Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
        Now the jingle hop has begun</p> <hr>
    </div>
    <div>  <h3> this is lyrics song </h3>
        <p>Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
            Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
            Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
            In the frosty air</p>
            <hr></div>
    <div> <h4> this is a last stage of making this lyrics</h4>
        <p>What a bright time, it's the right time
            To rock the night away
            Jingle bell time is a swell time
            To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh</p><hr>
    </div>
    <div> <h5>lyrics are lovely in reading</h5>
    <p>Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
        Jingle around the clock
        Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
        That's the jingle bell rock
        </p><hr>

    <div><h6>this line is last of lyrics</h6>
        <p>Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
            Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time
            Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
            In the frosty air</p><hr>
